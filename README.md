# Shop

**This is a Pet project for Store**

[I take layout from this Figma template](<https://www.figma.com/file/V8hUUniLNPiXcdBwr03iRq/75%2B-Ecommerce-%26-Shop-MultiPurpose-Template-(Community)>)

This is a template that does not have a responsive layout, but if I want, I can create them based on media queries.

This project is written on the technology stack:

1. NextJs
2. Axios
3. Ant Design
4. Sass
5. Storybook
6. Huski
7. Jest
8. Other...

The technologies you can see in "package.json"
